# Quizeo
Quizeo is a video teaching tool with the main goal to provide a more interactive experience for both the viewers and content creators. 
Instructors can upload videos and add quizes/surveys during their video for viewers to test their comprehension of the material. This data is then available to the video creator through their profile page. The quiz results will help viewers know how well they were able to learn the subject and they will help the instructors know how effective their lesson was.

# Plans for execution

I used https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player for displaying video links. This also had built in functionality for callback functions when a video finishes.

I used https://reacttraining.com/react-router/ to handle switching views without reloading the browser DOM.
